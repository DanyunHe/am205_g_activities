# Introduction to Python
This git repository contains the jupyter notebook presented at the Python tutorial.

The tutorial features three exercises for practicing Python syntax, as well as using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) libraries:
- Exercise 1 - Binary to decimal conversion, and its application to simulate a cellular automaton.
- Exercise 2 - Probability estimation through repeated random simulation, used to determine how likely the fragments of a rod broken in three will form a valid triangle.
- Exercise 3 - Visualization of 2D arrays as images, seen through an example of generating a variant of the Mandelbrot set.

Solutions for Exercise 1a, b and c are included in the solved ```.ipynb``` notebook. Separate solution codes for Exercises 2 and 3 will be posted after the writeup submission deadline.
